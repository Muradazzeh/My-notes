## paragraph 2
***How to learn things without going crazy***

what i understand from this paragragh.
every time we need to learn new things , or topics , what ever it is  from tech industry or enginnering field it will be difficult for some reasons , 
* first reasone is the amount off information that you can find on the internt,youtube like toturial.
* second reason is the long content , and how much time you will spend on the content , to reach the point where you can bulid your project.

>On the other hand you can follow some tips ,to help you ,to avoide the difficalties:

1. learn general idea fast , then step by step deep dive in the subjec, for example **The crush corses**
2. learn any thing by donig it , and dont do copy-past , try to make your own changes so you can undestand better.
3. Try to learn every things about the technology , not only the basics, and undestand how it is work.for example the ******documantation**** , or **manuals**.
> Finally you can choose one direction and try to build project and show every thing that you learned.
